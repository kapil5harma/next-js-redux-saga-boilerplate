## Boilerplate for Next - Redux - Saga

Steps to get started:

- clone this repository
- Run `npm install && npm run dev`

Note:

- bootstrapped using `create-next-app`
- uses components directory for common components
- uses containers for all stateful logic and routes
- serves routes from pages directory (using `next` router defaults)
- uses `redux` for state management
- uses `redux-saga` to handle side effects

* Do install and enable ESlint and prettier plugins (if it exists for the code editor of your choice, it does exist for VSCode).
* Else you can check your code against lint rules by running `npm run lint` and to fix errors (for auto fixable errors), run `npm run lint:fix`
